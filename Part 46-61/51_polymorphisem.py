# Polymorphism = Greek word that means to "have many forms or faces"
#       Poly   = Many
#       Morphe = Form
#
#       TWO WAYS TO ACHIEVE POLYMORPHISM
#       1. Inheritance    = An object could be treated of the same type as a parent class
#       2. "Duck typing"  = Object must have necessary attributes/methods

#1.Inheritance:
