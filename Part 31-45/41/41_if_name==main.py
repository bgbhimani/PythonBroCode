# if __name__ == __main__: 
# (this script can be imported OR run standalone)
# Functions and classep in this module can be reused
# without the main block of code executing
#       Good practice (code is modular,
#       helps readability,
#       leaves no global variables,
#       avoid unintended execution)

#       Ex. library = Import library for functionality
#                     When running library directly, display a help page
